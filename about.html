        <b>Skypotatoes</b>
        a.k.a. Ronan Dodds is a recent graduate of Northcoders.

      <p>
        I began learning Python in the summer of 2021, turning my hand to
        exercises such as coding hangman, tictactoe and sudoku solvers. In late
        2021, I was accepted onto the Northcoders bootcamp and in preparation
        for this I swapped out Python for JavaScript and cut my teeth on some
        Codewars Katas in preparation for the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Northcoders I have learnt to code in Javascript according to industry
        standards such as Pair Programming and Test Driven Development using
        Jest. I gained valuable experience of working with HTML, ReactJS, CSS,
        Firebase9, Bootstrap, Axios, PostgreSQL and Express JS.
