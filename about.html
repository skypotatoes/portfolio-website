<h1 class='title'>About skypotatoes</h1>
<p><b>skypotatoes</b> is a humble coder learning the craft.</p>
<p>I began to learn Python over the summer of 2021. As well as learning to code hangman and tictactoe,
    I created a script that could take snapshots of the Mandelbrot set from a particular set of coordinates 
    at a given magnification. Unfortunately, I seem to have inadvertantly lost the code I created, as well
    as most of the images, and below is the sole surviving image I made. I was excited to use my understanding
    of the square root of minus one combined with a rudimentary grasp on coding to generate the Mandelbrot set,
    and look forward to returning to this in the future. I have huge admiration for the people who conceived of
    this fractal shape and began exploring it in the early days of computing via laboriously printed black and 
    white images. One of my aspirations is to create a GUI that will allow easy exploration of Mandelbrot set
    and other fractals through a click-and-drag interface. </p>
<p>In late 2021, I was accepted onto the Northcoders bootcamp and in preparation for this I have swapped
    out Python for JavaScript and have been cutting my teeth on Codewars Katas. I am particularly enjoying
    those katas which exercise my ability with not just coding, but with mathematics, too. I am slowly picking
    up on the use of higher-order functions and how to optimise algorithms for faster performance.
